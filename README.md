# Vehicle-Driver Mapping System


## Overview

The **Vehicle-Driver Mapping System** is a web application designed to efficiently manage the assignment of drivers to vehicles. It provides a comprehensive interface for creating driver profiles, assigning them to vehicles, handling scheduling conflicts, and managing requests. This system is ideal for fleet management, ensuring smooth operations and avoiding scheduling overlaps.

## Features

- **Driver Creation:** Users can create and store driver profiles with necessary attributes, such as name, phone number, and location.
- **Vehicle-Driver Assignment:** Drivers can be assigned to vehicles with time-bound scheduling, preventing overlapping assignments.
- **Conflict Handling:** The system checks for scheduling conflicts and alerts users if a driver is already assigned during a given timeframe.
- **Driver Assignment Requests:** Drivers can receive, accept, or reject assignment requests.
- **Location-Based Assignment:** Users can search for available drivers based on proximity to a specified location.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
